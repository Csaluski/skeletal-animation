# Skeletal animation blog

This is a series of blog posts where I build up a toy skeletal animation system for the web. 
I started this project to learn Svelte and become more familiar with making a real web program. 

The live version of this site can hopefully be found on my website, at [http://enfys.xyz/blog/animation](http://enfys.xyz/blog/animation). 
If it's not available it's probably because I messed something up.

To run this site locally, clone the repo, then run `npm install` and `npm run dev`, then visit the localhost URL provided.
